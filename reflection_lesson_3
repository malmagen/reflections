When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working on another computer. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because maybe you are not done with the feature. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used inorder to copy someones existing work on github, clones are used on your own repository, and branches when you want to try something out. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

If you want to work offline or donâ€™t have access to the internet you can still work on the project and make sure you are up to date.
